# Confirm that the relation between J2,J4 and precession of $\tilde{\omega}& and $\Omega$ and estimating the Laplace plane around Saturn.

**See REBOUNDx for adding extra forces to REBOUND, in particular: [Graviational Harmonics](https://github.com/dtamayo/reboundx/blob/master/ipython_examples/J2.ipynb)**

 
(5 POINTS) 1 - Using the python version of [REBOUND](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the 
[REBOUNDx](https://github.com/dtamayo/reboundx/) extra forces package, follow the evolution of test particles around Saturn and confirm the analytic 
expressions in Sections 2.6.2 of the text.  Report the measured and analytic values as degrees/day and in dimensionless units.

(10 POINTS) 2 - Add Tritan to your simulation from *1* and determine at what orbital distance from Saturn the analytic expressions fail.  Then, considering a series of circular orbits
spaced between the exterior of Saturn and orbit of Tritan plot the inclination of Saturn's [Laplace plane ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_plane) versus orbital distance from Saturn in units of Saturn radii.
